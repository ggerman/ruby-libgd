# ruby-libgd Community

ruby-libgd is more than a gem — it is a native graphics engine for Ruby.

We use **GitHub Discussions** as the main place to:
- ask questions
- share examples
- propose ideas
- discuss the roadmap

---

## 🗣 Where to talk

👉 https://github.com/ggerman/ruby-libgd/discussions

Use Discussions for:
- "How do I draw X?"
- "Is it possible to render Y?"
- "What should come next?"

Use Issues only for:
- bugs
- concrete feature requests

---

## 🚀 Show what you built

If you built something with ruby-libgd:
- post screenshots
- share code
- show your images

We want to make Ruby a real graphics platform again.
